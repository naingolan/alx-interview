# 0x00-pascal_triangle

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of Pascal's Triangle in JavaScript. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.

## Implementation
The `pascalTriangle` function in `pascal_triangle.js` generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. It takes an integer `numRows` as input and returns a 2D array representing the triangle.

## Usage
To use the Pascal's Triangle generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x00-pascal_triangle.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd 0x00-pascal_triangle

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. Enter the desired number of rows in the input field.

5. Click the "Generate Triangle" button.

6. The Pascal's Triangle will be displayed below the button.
